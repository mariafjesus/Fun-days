# Fun-days
## CS50 Final Project
### Video Demo: TODO
### How I reached this point:
#### In the begining of January another lockdown was implemented in Portugal and online classes restarted. This time I decided I was really going to spend my time wisely. I had already heard about CS50 about a year from then. Although, I had watched some of the first lectures and I loved it, I never explored anything more. However, I decided that I was going to take CS50 course on my free time and finally learn programming, and so I started. It was extremely rewarding to know I was learning something new and important that was not only fun and exiting but also usefull. I am forever grateful for CS50!
### Final Project Idea:
#### After realising what I could do in my free time during quarantine I had the idea of creating a website that would guide other kids and teens to use their free time as best as possible. I had the idea of creating Fun Days where my goal is to help kids, teens, adults and really anyone to try something new to create memories and really explore their full potencial and who knows they might find something they are really passionate about.
### Fun Days Description:
#### On this website I wanted to encourage people to try new things and explore new activities they never tried. Through some filters this web application suggests you some activities to try, perhaps learn programming, making a special dish or inventing your own story. My ultimate goal is to help people realise how many things they could do instead of watching TV or social media and to engage with new activities that make them happy.
