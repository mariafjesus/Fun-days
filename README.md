# Fun-days
##CS50 Final Project
### Video Demo: 
### How I reached this point:
#### In the begining of January another lockdown was implemented in Portugal and online classes restarted. This time I decided I was really going to spend my time wisely. I had already heard about CS50 about a year from then and I had actually watched some of the first lectures and I loved it but I never explored anything more nor did any lab or problem set. However, I decided that I was going to take CS50 course and finally learn to programming and so I started. All my free time I was progressing and it was extremely rewarding to know I was learning something new and important that was not only fun and exiting but also usefull. I am forever grateful of CS50!
### Final Project Idea:
#### After realising what I could do in my free time during quarantine I had the idea of creating a website that would guide other kinds and teens to use their time as best as possible. I had the idea of creating Fun Days my goal is to help kids, teens, adults and really anyone to try something new to create memories and to leave classic free time activities at least for sometime and inovate and really explore their full potencial and who knows find their passion.
### Fun Days Description:
#### On this website I wanted to encurage people to try new things and explore new activities they never tried. Through some filters this web application suggests you some activities to try, perhaps learn programming making a special cake or inventing your own story. My ultimate goal is to help people realise how many things they could do instead of watching TV or social media and to engage with new activities and feel happy.
